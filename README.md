## Usage ##

This script serves the sole purpose of collecting troubleshooting information from a Windows server with ease.

To use it, one simply needs to execute the following command in the command line 
  ```
    $ gather_stats.bat
  ```

After that, a folder will be created with all the information.

Hope you find it helpful! :)
